  I want to calculate Fibonacci numbers
  So that I can work with this important mathematical sequence

  Scenario: Calculate Fibonacci number at position 0
    Given I have a calculator
    When I calculate the Fibonacci number at position 0
    Then the result should be 0

  Scenario: Calculate Fibonacci number at position 1
    Given I have a calculator
    When I calculate the Fibonacci number at position 1
    Then the result should be 1

  Scenario: Calculate Fibonacci number at position 2
    Given I have a calculator
    When I calculate the Fibonacci number at position 2
    Then the result should be 1

  Scenario: Calculate Fibonacci number at position 3
    Given I have a calculator
    When I calculate the Fibonacci number at position 3
    Then the result should be 2

  Scenario: Calculate Fibonacci for negative number
    Given I have a calculator
    When I try to calculate the Fibonacci number at position -1
    Then it should throw an IllegalArgumentException with message "Input must be non-negative"

  Scenario: Calculate Fibonacci for non number
    Given I have a calculator
    When I calculate the Fibonacci number at position "abc"
    Then it should throw an NumberFormatException with message "Cannot calculate string value!"
